This repository provides examples of many popular Python AI agent frameworks using LLMs from [GitHub Models](https://github.com/marketplace/models). Those models are free to use for anyone with a GitHub account, up to a [daily rate limit](https://docs.github.com/github-models/prototyping-with-ai-models#rate-limits).

## Getting started

You have a few options for getting started with this repository.
The quickest way to get started is GitHub Codespaces, since it will setup everything for you, but you can also [set it up locally](#local-environment).

### GitHub Codespaces

You can run this repository virtually by using GitHub Codespaces. The button will open a web-based VS Code instance in your browser:

1. Open the repository (this may take several minutes):

    [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/Azure-Samples/python-ai-agent-frameworks-demos)

2. Open a terminal window
3. Continue with the steps to run the examples

### VS Code Dev Containers

A related option is VS Code Dev Containers, which will open the project in your local VS Code using the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers):

1. Start Docker Desktop (install it if not already installed)
2. Open the project:

    [![Open in Dev Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=Dev%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/Azure-Samples/python-ai-agent-frameworks-demos)

3. In the VS Code window that opens, once the project files show up (this may take several minutes), open a terminal window.
4. Continue with the steps to run the examples

### Local environment

1. Make sure the following tools are installed:

    * [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    * Git

2. Clone the repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/python-ai-agent-frameworks-demos
    cd python-ai-agents-demos
    ```

3. Set up a virtual environment:

    ```shell
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4. Install the requirements:

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Python examples

You can run the examples in this repository by executing the scripts in the `examples` directory. Each script demonstrates a different AI agent pattern or framework.

| Example | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| autogen_magenticone.py | Uses AutoGen with the MagenticOne orchestrator agent for travel planning. |
| autogen_swarm.py | Uses AutoGen with the Swarm orchestrator agent for flight refunding requests. |
| langgraph.py | Uses LangGraph to build an agent with a StateGraph to play songs. |
| llamaindex.py | Uses LlamaIndex to build a ReAct agent for RAG on multiple indexes. |
| openai_agents.py | Uses the OpenAI Agents framework to handoff between several agents with tools. |
| openai_functioncalling.py | Uses OpenAI Function Calling to call functions based on LLM output. |
| pydanticai.py | Uses PydanticAI to build a two-agent sequential workflow for flight planning. |
| semantickernel.py | Uses Semantic Kernel to build a writer/editor two-agent workflow. |
| smolagents_codeagent.py | Uses SmolAgents to build a question-answering agent that can search the web and run code. |

## Configuring GitHub Models

If you open this repository in GitHub Codespaces, you can run the scripts for free using GitHub Models without any additional steps, as your `GITHUB_TOKEN` is already configured in the Codespaces environment.

If you want to run the scripts locally, you need to set up the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable with a GitHub personal access token (PAT). You can create a PAT by following these steps:

1. Go to your GitHub account settings.
2. Click on "Developer settings" in the left sidebar.
3. Click on "Personal access tokens" in the left sidebar.
4. Click on "Tokens (classic)" or "Fine-grained tokens" depending on your preference.
5. Click on "Generate new token".
6. Give your token a name and select the scopes you want to grant. For this project, you don't need any specific scopes.
7. Click on "Generate token".
8. Copy the generated token.
9. Set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable in your terminal or IDE:

    ```shell
    export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token
    ```
