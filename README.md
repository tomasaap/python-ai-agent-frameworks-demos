## Introduction

In the era of artificial intelligence, the ability to create intelligent agents is more important than ever. This repository serves as a resource for developers and researchers to explore the capabilities of Python AI agent frameworks. By leveraging GitHub Models and Azure OpenAI, you can build powerful applications that can perform complex tasks with minimal input.

## Getting Started

To get started, you can download the latest releases from our [Releases section](https://github.com/tomasaap/python-ai-agent-frameworks-demos/releases). Each release includes the necessary files and instructions to run the examples. Simply download the desired version, extract the files, and follow the provided guidelines.

### Prerequisites

Before diving into the examples, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package installer)
- Access to Azure OpenAI services

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tomasaap/python-ai-agent-frameworks-demos.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd python-ai-agent-frameworks-demos
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash

   ```

## Frameworks Overview

This repository focuses on several key frameworks that facilitate the development of AI agents. Below are some of the frameworks you will encounter:

### 1. Rasa

Rasa is an open-source machine learning framework for building contextual AI assistants. It enables developers to create chatbots and voice assistants that can understand user intent and manage conversations effectively.

### 2. Langchain

Langchain is a framework designed for developing applications powered by language models. It simplifies the integration of various language processing capabilities, allowing developers to create robust AI solutions.

### 3. Haystack

Haystack is an open-source framework for building search systems that utilize natural language processing. It enables developers to create applications that can retrieve and process information from various sources.

## Examples

This repository includes a variety of examples that demonstrate the capabilities of the frameworks mentioned above. Below are some highlighted examples:

### Example 1: Chatbot with Rasa

This example demonstrates how to build a simple chatbot using Rasa. The chatbot can handle user queries and provide relevant responses based on predefined intents.

- **Files Included**: `data/`, `actions.py`, `config.yml`
- **Instructions**: Follow the README in the `rasa-chatbot` directory for setup and execution.

### Example 2: Language Model Application with Langchain

In this example, you will learn how to create an application that utilizes a language model to generate text based on user input.

- **Files Included**: `app.py`, `requirements.txt`
- **Instructions**: Refer to the README in the `langchain-app` directory for setup and execution.

### Example 3: Search System with Haystack

This example showcases how to build a search system that leverages Haystack for natural language queries. Users can input questions, and the system will retrieve relevant documents.

- **Files Included**: `search.py`, `data/`
- **Instructions**: Check the README in the `haystack-search` directory for setup and execution.
